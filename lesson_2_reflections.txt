What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It initializes or creates a new git repository. You need it to create a .git directory. 
When you initialize a repository git does not create commits for you, you have to create the commits yourself.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area differs from the working directory in that it allows you to pick which file or files you want to add to your repository in a single commit. This is valuable because you can organize your repository by commits and it gives you the control.
