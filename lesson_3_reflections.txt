When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would create a remote repository so you can collaborate with others and so you can work on your project from different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To give me control over what changes are added and when.
